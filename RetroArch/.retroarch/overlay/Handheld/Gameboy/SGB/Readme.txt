This is a collection of default borders from the SGB/SGB2 adapters on the SNES and Super Famicom. This serves as a follow-up to the handheld overlays I made for the RG351P. While the other handhelds were fairly stylized, the Game Boy Color border was just a plain black border with a battery indicator. I wanted to create other options to make up for it.

Place the contents in RetroArch's overlay folder. You can also create a new folder where you place your roms (basically, create any folder that you can access from RetroArch). To apply overlays, go to Quick Menu > On-Screen Overlay > Overlay Preset and look for the folder you placed the overlay files in. 

===Video Settings===

For best results, chage the video settings for handhelds to:
- Integer scale on
- Aspect ratio = 1:1 par
- Bilinear Filtering and RGA Scaling off
- (optional) you can also apply a grid-type shader like "lcd3x" or "bevel"

To save the overlay for the core (i.e. for all games), go to Quick Menu > Overrides > Save Core Overrides.

To save the overlay just for the current game, go to Quick Menu > Overrides > Save Game Overrides instead.

*While the Game Gear has a different aspect ratio, using the settings above makes it identical to the GB/GBC resolution on the RG351P/M, so you can use these borders for Game Gear games too.

===Game Boy and Game Boy Color===

To have different overlays for Game Boy and Game Boy Color, sort the roms into separate folders (gb|gbc). Open a GB game, apply the overlay, and go to Quick Menu > Overrides > Save Content Directory Overrides. Do the same for a GBC game.
